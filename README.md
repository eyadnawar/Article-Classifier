# Article-Classifier

In this project, I built an article classifier from scratch, implementing the Naiive Bayes model. 

The Classifier tags articles with one of five categories (Sports/politics/entertainment/business/tech) after training on 4000 articles of each category scraped from the BBC website.

This model achieved a 98\% accuracy on the test set.
